## CatalyticTweaks

A simple aimed to do some general changes to modpacks of Catalyst Studios.

Currently there are 2 mods supported:

- Pipez: Allows all upgrades to have all options (no need for diamond upgrade when you just need redstone on a basic one). Fully customizable

- Modular Machinery Reborn: Changes parallel (1 recipe per machine), changes preview and other changes to make it less painful to TPS (original mod has methods to reduce the lag, just that on 64+ parallel it starts to notice). Able to do 2k parallel with 20 tps. Also disable the void items on fail.
